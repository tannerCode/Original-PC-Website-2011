    <ul id="answers">
        <li class="answers">No you do not, as that is a part of the total trip cost. But, because we get students from all over the states, you have to cover your trip to LAX, as that is our central base to fly out. </li>
        <li class="answers">Every breakfast and dinner except 8, as we want to offer you a chance to try out the local cuisine. Lunches are not included, as we are constantly on the move so it usually involves packing a quick sandwich.</li>
        <li class="answers">If you have one, bring it, if not, we can set up a way for you to either have one or share with other students.</li>
        <li class="answers">Yes. The best would be a mummy bag that is at least a 30-degree bag.  Check out REI or steep and cheap for a sleeping bag, plus a linear is always a good addition.</li>
        <li class="answers">Most students have found that they are able to complete their schoolwork without the help of their own laptop. If you do decide to bring a computer, they are always kept safe and secure, but one should bring a carrying case for it.</li>
        <li class="answers">The course work is integrated into the program and you will meet regularly with your professors.</li>
        <li class="answers">The credits are split up into three sections, before, during and after the trip.  Before you leave, some of the classes will ask for a paper on pre-conceived notions or reading the history of the land.</li>
        <li class="answers">The beauty of the program is that anyone can participate in it.  It is set up for all ranges of experience, and the program will be flexible with whatever skills you feel comfortable with.</li>
        <li class="answers">Nope, as the gear is there for us.  Just bring a good attitude and a willingness to try anything!</li>
        <li class="answers">As long as you let us know in advance, we will work that into the food preparation.</li>
        <li class="answers">In every town we visit there is Internet access that you can use on a per hour basis. Phone cards are also readily available in New Zealand and Australia.</li>
        <li class="answers">You will be staying in all sorts of diverse accommodations, from tenting on top of a mountain to a luxury apartment in Sydney.</li>
        <li class="answers">Free days have been allotted during the trip, about one per week, in towns or cities where there is plenty to do or catch up on emails, coursework, laundry and other needs.</li>
        <li class="answers">Yes!</li>
