    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Since its inception, in 1985, Pacific Challenge has taken over 1000 students and graduates on our unique experiential travel programs, utilizing a staff of experienced and qualified leaders and faculty.<br>
We offer unique and extensively researched study abroad and experiential programs to the most exciting places on earth, carefully blending adventure, cultural immersion, eco-tourism ideals, personal and leadership development, and bundles of fun!<br>
The option to combine this with up to a semester of US college credit gives you an unbeatable travel/study experience.<br>
Through meaningful and challenging experiential travel we assist participants in gaining the skills, confidence and insight to realize their potential in an increasingly global society; developing empathy for other cultures; furthering understanding of international issues; and heightening appreciation for the earth's wilderness and diversity.<br>
Pacific Challenge programs span an ideal middle ground of experiential education philosophies. We take the best elements of the adventure/challenge and personal growth opportunities found in Outward Bound and N.O.L.S style courses. Then, use those elements alongside relevant optional college classes to create a valuable, rewarding and unique educational experience in stimulating and fascinating international settings.<br>
Pacific Challenge helps you 'get beneath the skin' of the countries you visit &#8722; meet the local people on their terms, learn about history and culture, and enjoy wilderness experiences that don't damage the environment.<br>
Join us today!

    <p>&quotTwenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the 
    ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. 
    Explore... dream... discover.&quot
